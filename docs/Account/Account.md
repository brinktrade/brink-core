## `Account`

Deployed once and used by many Proxy contracts as the implementation contract




### `constructor(contract CallExecutor callExecutor)` (public)

This sets state on the canonical Account contract, not the proxies
Proxy contracts read from canonical Account state through their implementation() address


Constructor sets call executor and the owner of ExecutorAccessController


### `storageLoad(bytes32 ptr) â†’ bytes32 data` (external)



Loads bytes32 data stored at the given pointer


### `externalCall(uint256 value, address to, bytes data)` (external)



Makes a call to an external contract
Only executable directly by the proxy owner


### `delegateCall(address to, bytes data)` (external)



Makes a delegatecall to an external contract


### `metaDelegateCall(address to, bytes data, bytes signature)` (external)



Makes a delegatecall to an external contract with message data signed by the proxy owner


### `metaPartialSignedDelegateCall(address to, bytes data, bytes signature, bytes unsignedData)` (external)



Makes a delegatecall to an external contract with message data signed by the proxy owner and unsigned data
provided by the executor (msg.sender)
