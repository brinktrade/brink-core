### `constructor(uint256 chainId_)` (public)



Constructor sets CHAIN_ID immutable constant

### `storageLoad(bytes32 ptr) â†’ bytes32 data` (external)



Loads bytes32 data stored at the given pointer


### `externalCall(uint256 value, address to, bytes data)` (external)



Makes a call to an external contract
Only executable directly by the proxy owner


### `delegateCall(address to, bytes data)` (external)
